# README

There are two folders within this repository, one for the classifier and one for the diffusion model.

The signal processing data augmentation is contained within both repositories, with it being integrated with the classifier.
The diffusion folder is where the driver code for training diffusion models lies as well as inference with the trained diffusion models.
The classifier folder contains the driver code for training and evaluating the classifier models that have been developed so far.
